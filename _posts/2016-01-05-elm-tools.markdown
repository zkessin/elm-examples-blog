One thing I miss in Elm is some of the tools from Erlang, the Elm Type
checker is amazing, but there are some other things that would be
great. I have gotten used to using
[Wrangler](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/wrangler/Wrangler/Home.html)
whihc lets me do all sots of of cool things like mark a chunk of code
and move it to a new function or move a function to a different
module, and update all the refrences.

SOmething like wrangler for elm would be great.
